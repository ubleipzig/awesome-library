# Awesome Library Tools and Resources [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

More and more tools and projects by and for libraries are becoming available on the internet. We would like to curate a list of various software, tools, resources and projects, which are useful when working within a library context.

At the moment, this is a single list, but at some point, we should group the links as some categories emerge.

[Contributions](contributing.md) welcome.

Inspired by [these curated collections](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome). Also note [awesome-rse](https://github.com/geyslein/awesome-rse) for a list of resources for Research Software Engineers and Engineering (RSE).
